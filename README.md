# xword

** Version 0.2 **

This program was created to allow users to create their own crossword puzzle, similar to those found in the New York Times.

## Design
Users will be able to write in their own 'answers' in the board and add the corresponding clue on the side. Using the Solve button will automatically fill in the remaining empty squares in the puzzle with clues and answers. From there, the user can share the puzzle for others to complete.
